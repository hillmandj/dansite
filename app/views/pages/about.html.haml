    a Jewelry/Tech company in TriBeCa. I am a self taught programmer, and do a lot of development on the side.

    I attended
    = link_to 'Oberlin College', 'http://www.oberlin.edu', :target => '_blank'
    and graduated in 2008 with a Bachelors in Economics. After dabbling in finance for a couple of years, I figured out that
    all I really want to do is work with computers. Aside from programming, other things I'm into include:
    biking, skiing, playing basketball or soccer, fantasy sports, graphic novels, & video games. If you ever want to talk about
    programming, or would like to collaborate on a project, please feel free to reach out!
